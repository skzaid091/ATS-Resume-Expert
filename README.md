### Prerequisites

3. Get your Google API key and set it in the `.env` file.
   (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) go to this link and login if required and hit the Button "Create API Key" and copy that API Key and paste it in .env file.
4. You need to install "poppler" but don't worry I've attached a directly downloaded folder as a zip with this repo named as "poppler-24.02.0" just unzip it and move the folder the to following path "C:\Program Files".
5. If the poppler's folder location is different than the above then update this line in the code as "poppler_path='Location to the Folder".
